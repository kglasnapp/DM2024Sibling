On the previous robot, the RoboRIO was mounted upside down and the gyro code still seems to be inverted. See DrivetrainSubsystem
How to/is driver yaw and field yaw kept track of? Important for megatag2 and auto.
Maybe use option for pose, and return none/null until good yaw is obtained
It would be cool if we switched to radians everywhere
